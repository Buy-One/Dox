tempo & pitch formula

the formula to determine how many cents you adjust to change loop tempos is:
Td = Desired tempo
Ts = Current Sample tempo
n = Detuning (in cents: 1200 cents = 1 octave, tempered scale)
n = ( 1200 / log[2] ) x log[Td / Ts]

Try entering it into a Scientific Calculator (like the one provided in Windows) like this:

Desired tempo / Current tempo = log * 1200 / 2 log = Detuning in Cents

1 ms (millisecond) = 0.001 seconds = 1/60000 minutes

4/4 time signature

note length to milliseconds

1/2 = 60000 ms / BPM * 2
1/4 (crotchet) note delay time in ms = 60000 ms / BPM 
1/8 (quaver) = 60000 ms / BPM / 2
1/16 (semi-quaver) = 60000 ms / BPM / 4
1/32 = 60000 ms / BPM / 8

dotted note - multiply the result times 1.5
triplet note - multiply the result times 0.666

or

1/2 = 240 000 / BPM / 2
1/4 = 240 000 / BPM / 4

and so on

by dividing 240 000 by the tempo value we obtain the duration of one bar at 4/4 
time signature

-----------------------------------

hertz to milliseconds

1 second/value in hertz * 1000 (milliseconds in 1 s)


milliseconds to hertz 

1/(value in ms : 1000) 


----------------------------------------------------------------------

ms to samples

ms x sample rate = samples


samples to ms

_______________________________________

formula for calculating the exact delay time in milliseconds

(60 * 1 / tempo) * (4 / time division) or the simplified equation: 240 / tempo / time 
division where time division is a coefficient with the following values:

Normal

1 bar 	= 1
half bar = 2
1/4 	= 4
1/8 	= 8
1/16 	= 16
1/32 	= 32
1/64 	= 64
	
Triplets

1/2t 	= 3
1/4t 	= 6
1/8t 	= 12
1/16t 	= 24
1/32t 	= 48
1/64t 	= 96
	
Dotted

1/2d 	= 1.333
1/4d 	= 2.666
1/8d 	= 5.333
1/16d 	= 10.666
1/32d 	= 21.333
1/64d 	= 42.666

So if you're looking for the exact delay time for a quarter note on a tempo of 124 bpm, 
the formula is:
240 / 124 / 4 = 483 ms, which is equivalent to Head 3 (mode 3 or 7) with repeat rate 
at minimum.

Or if you want to play Pink Floyd's "Run Like Hell", you have a tempo of 115 bpm 
and one eighth note dotted, so you have:
240 / 115 / 5.333 = 391 ms, which is equivalent to Head 3 (mode 3 or 7) with repeat 
rate two notches below the middle... more or less.

===================================================================

WAV/AIFF file size formula

sample rate (e.g. 44100) x bit rate (e.g. 16) x channel count x duraction in sec = size in bits

size in bytes = size in bits / 8

size in kilobytes = size in bits / 8 / 1024

size in megabytes = size in bits / 8 / 1024 / 1024


===================================================================

Dotted grid/note is multiplication by 3/2

e.g. 1/8 dotted = 3/16

Triplet grid/note is multiplication by 2/3

e.g. 1/8 triplet = 1/12

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5XqgHdWsH8


===================================================================


A triplet note denominator is a sum of straight note denominator + half of the straight note denominator: 

1/3 = 1/2 + 1; 1/6 = 1/4 + 2; 1/12 = 1/8 + 4; 1/24 = 1/16 + 8; 1/48 = 1/32 + 16; 1/96 = 1/64 + 32


A triplet note notation shows what whole notes are contained in it

1/3 = 1/2 + 1/1 = 1 half note + 2 half notes = 3 half notes
1/6 = 1/4 + 1/2 = 1 quarter note + 2 quarter notes = 3 quarter notes
1/12 = 1/8 + 1/4 = 1 eight note + 2 eight notes = 3 eight notes

etc

Как выяснить темп трека размера 4/4 без BPM анализаторов


1. Загрузить файл трека в аудиоредактор, который показывает временнУю 
информацию об аудиофайле

2. Отыскать в треке четвертные доли

3. Установить маркеры, поместив их точно в начале каждой доли (обычно на 
них стоят кик и снэр, поэтому определение транзиента не должно составить 
труда)

4. Измерить расстояние между двумя смежными четвертными долями 
в миллисекундах (обычно для этого нужно просто выделить зону между двумя
маркерами, которыми эти доли отмечены, и время отобразится на панели 
состояния аудиоредактора)

5. Рассчитать по формуле 60000 / Т мс, где 60000 - это кол-во миллисекунд 
в одной минуте, а Т мс - это время между двумя смежными четвертными 
долями в миллисекундах
либо 60 / Т с, где 60 - это кол-во секунд, а Т с - время ежду двумя 
смежными четвертными долями в секундах

                 Mixer In R Delta-AP

When settings are correct the destination track meter displays moving yellow bars

Mute the output to avoid feedback loop

=======================================================

To record MIDI output of a track create a MIDI send to the recording track, right click it's Record buttom and set Record: output -> Record: output (MIDI), Input:none (if doesn't work, then Input: MIDI -> All MIDI inputs -> All Channels). Both menus are available on the TCP as well.

=======================================================

To record web audio stream


Select WASAPI driver in Preferences -> Audio -> Device

Recording settings: Record: Input (audio or MIDI), Input: Stereo [or Mono depending on the needs]

Record monitoring must be OFF to prevent feedback loop

Arm record track, the meter must indicate signal.


=======================================================

When using multiout setup, despite the mono output number of the plugin being 1 the actual send mono channel ordinal number corresponds to its number in the overall list of channels nboth mono and stereo, where stereo channels precede the mono.
Hence if there're 16 stereo outputs and then some mono, mono output 1 equals to mono channel 17 (the first after 16) in the send mono channels list and so forth.

For multiout setup to work the number of channels on the track with the multiout plugin inserted must be changed to reflect the number of required outputs

=======================================================

For send effect to respond to stereo image settings on the track it's inserted on, the send must be set to mono even if the input signal is already mino.


=======================================================

To both recieve a multiout plugin output and send MIDI to it using the same track, track Feedback loop must be enabled in the Project settings.


=======================================================

To control send level of children tracks to an effect outside of a folder firsr rlink oute them to a link track inside the folder, disable its master/parent send output, group it with the folder track as a volume slave while folder track volume is a master, and route it to the outside effect channel.

MIDI busses

https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=166544

All the MIDI on a track will be sent to the plug-in. There are options for the plug-in to receive MIDI, and, if so, on which bus (MIDI Bus #1 is the default). 

Within the plug-in, different processing can be applied to MIDI on different MIDI channels (e.g. Kontakt, SampleTank etc can route the different channels to different instruments, but Reaper knows nothing of that).

There are also options for the output of MIDI from that plug-in:
-- it can be disabled, in which case the MIDI input to the plug-in is passed to the next plug-in
-- it can replace the MIDI input completely (that's the default) in which case the MIDI input to the plug-in is discarded and the MIDI output by the plug-in passed to the next plug-in
-- they can be merged, so the next plug-in gets both sets of MIDI.
-- you can put the MIDI on any MIDI bus

JS FX are different:
-- the input MIDI is always discarded,
-- the only MIDI passed to the next plug-in is any MIDI output by the JS FX itself

Does that shed any light on things?

Thinking about it, you could use a JS FX to put MIDI onto different busses and have several VSTis on the track each listening out for a different bus.

MIDI Busses in Reaper can be thought of as 16 separate steams of MIDI, each of which can have MIDI on 16 channels.
* the default MIDI Bus is #1,
* track Sends can send MIDI from a selected MIDI Bus (or MIDI Channel or both),
* track Sends can put MIDI on a selected MIDI Bus (or MIDI Channel or both),
* plug-ins can receive MIDI from any selected MIDI Bus,
* plug-ins can output MIDI to any selected MIDI Bus,

One of uses for MIDI busses is for VST3 plugins that support multiple MIDI ports (like Vienna Instruments Pro), you can link MIDI busses to MIDI ports and essentially send over more than 16 MIDI channels to one plugin.


https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=197276

User guide might provide information on Midi Buses in section 17.19. 

Each track features a Midi chain allowing plugins to receive Midi events from and send Midi events to. By default any plugin digests all events from the previous one in the chain, so that only those it sends are propagated, but Reaper also can be configured to propagate the events present at that plugin's input and merge them with it's output (see "n in m out" -> "I/O" menu).

The primary input to that chain is handled in a very similar way to audio information (track input selection from "hardware" devices, arming the track, routing between tracks, ...).

Very similar to audio streams, the output of the chain (i.e. of the last plugin in the FX "plugin chain") can be routed to the input of other tracks and/or to Midi output "hardware" devices.

Additionally there are 16 Midi buses that are accessible by plugins globally (independent of their location in an FX chain) as a source and a destination of Midi events (configurable via the "n in m out" -> "I/O" menu).

The dedicated plugin "ReaControlMidi" can read and send Midi messages (in the normal way configurable from/to the appropriate FX-chain or a Midi Bus). Besides other things, it can link Midi CC messages to automatable parameters of other plugins in that track in a bidirectional way (providing possibilities for complex realtime automation between plugins and midi based hardware controllers). Moreover, it can show ("log") the Midi traffic.


Besides the tracks' FX Midi chains and the 16 Midi Buses, there is yet another global Midi Bus called the "Reaper control path", which is dedicated to feeding Midi events to any functionality that is not provided by a plugin loaded in an FX chain such as:
- Events can be fired by Midi events occurring in the "Reaper control path".
- The Midi "learn" functionality of the "param" menu (provided for any plugin) accesses the "Reaper control path".
- Reaper extensions (e.g. "SWS Live Configs", see the user Guide of same on how it makes use of the "Reaper control path") and ReaScripts (???) can access the "Reaper control path" (but not the tracks' Midi chains nor the Midi Buses).
- ... ? ? ?

The only (?) functionality, which is not provided by a plugin, that accesses tracks' FX Midi chains or one of the 16 Midi Buses, is what is provided by
..... "Param" -> "FX parameter List" -> "Param modulation / Midi Link" -> "..." -> "Link from MIDI or FX parameter" -> "MIDI" ....
Here, the functionality can be configured to Read Midi CC events from the track's FX chain or one of the 16 global Midi buses.

The "hardware" input to the "Reaper control path" is configured in the "Midi devices" section of the configuration menu by checking "Enable input for control messages".

The only other input to the "Reaper control path" (I know of) is provided by the dedicated "MidiToReaControlPath" VST plugin.

(AFAIK) There is no hardware output from the "Reaper control path".

Of course the Midi I/O devices can be called "buses", as well as the outputs can be used to feed multiple track inputs, while the outputs get the messages routed to them and merged from multiple tracks. 

There is yet another midi bus I forgot: The output of the "Virtual Keyboard" can be routed to multiple tracks. I seem to remember that I once have been told, that there are other functionalities that feed this bus, but I can't remember what they are. 


https://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=2091135&postcount=4

MIDI ports is not the same thing as MIDI busses. Reaper supports up to 64 hardware MIDI ports (source: https://askjf.com/index.php?q=3779s), yes. 16 MIDI busses are used internally for routing purposes. Completely different things.

If you read page 350-351 of the Reaper manual, it starts out with routing MIDI then goes in routing using buses.

=====================================================================


the volume of RS5K can be controlled by CC7 in the Midi Editor. An "Offset" of -50% & Scale at 100%, will give you +0.0dB when CC7 = 127.

The graph is tied to "Min vol" which is actually a "Velocity Intensity" dynamic control. If you set the "Min vol" ot a -66.2dB, you will get the maximum volume change with velocities 1 to 127. Any changes from -66.2dB to -inf are ineffective and have no affect.

Time base

The default project timebase is
Timebase for items/envelopes/markers: Beats (position, length, rate)
Timebase for tempo/time signature envelope: Beats

Timebase for audio items changes according to project timebase settings, unless it is changed in the individual audio item settings.

Timebase for MIDI items is always beats (position, length, rate), unless it is changed in the individual MIDI item settings.


MIDI

When MIDI item timebase is set to project/track default, MIDI item will always keep it's position and length in beats.

If the tempo is changed slower, MIDI item will play back slower and vice versa. 


AUDIO

When project timebase is set to Time, audio item will keep it's position and length in seconds. 
Changes in tempo won't change the playback rate.

When project timebase is set to Beats (position, length, rate), audio item will keep it's position and length in beats. 
If the tempo is changed slower, audio item will play back slower and vice versa.

When project timebase is set to Beats (position only), audio item will keep it's starting position in beats and length in seconds.
Changes in tempo won't change the playback rate.

-- Time Base summary


1. Beats (position, length, rate) --> items fully adapt to tempo changes, including getting slowed down or sped up with rate change
which in turn makes sure items relative length is maintained

2. Beats (position) --> only start (position) of items adapts to tempo change, the rate doesn't change and hence no length change

3. Time --> tempo changes are ignored, position of items is absolute on the timeline no matter the tempo


If tempo changes are effected with tempo markers / tempo envelope, their time base must match those of items/envelopes/markers (project)

-- Find item tempo


Method 1

1. Create a time selection over the item which encompasses exactly 1 measure (bar)
To make fine adjustments to time selection start/end points click time selection edge, hold down Ctr+Shift and move them with the mouse
2. Right click the Ruler and run 'Create measure from time selection (detect tempo, try to create a single measure)'

If item's time base is 'Beats (position length and rate)' its length will change after the tempo detection.
If item's time base is 'Time' or 'Beats (position only)' its length won't change.
As a result of the action tempo markers will be created, so undo it and input the calculated tempo manually.

Alternatively set item time base to 'Time' or 'Beats (position only)' and instead of 'Create measure from time selection'
run 'Set project tempo from time selection (detect tempo)' from the same menu.
Then restore the item time base if needed.


Method 2

1. Set item's time base to Time' or 'Beats (position only)' so its length isn't affected by tempo changes
2. Figure out the beginning of the measure in the item
3. Alighn the beginning of the measure in the item with the beginning of a measure on the grid
4. Place the edit cursor at the start of the item's measure
5. Insert a tempo marker by right clicking the Ruler and running action 'Insert tempo/time signature marker...'
without making any changes in the tempo marker properties (probably except the time signature if it's other than 4/4)
6. Place the edit cursor at the end of a measure on the grid
7. Insert another tempo marker the same way as in the step 5
8. Hold down Ctrl and move the 2nd tempo marker to the end of the measure within the item.
9. The project global tempo and the tempo of the 1st marker will be updated with the new value
10. Restore the item time base

Xenakios/SWS: Move selected items to edit cursor - moves all selected items to edit cursor independently of one another

SWS: Select only parent(s) of selected folder track(s) - selects Master track as parent if a folder parent or any 1st level track happens to be selected

Track: Unselect all tracks - doesn't unselect Master track, to unselect Master track use SWS: Unselect master track

Item properties: Pitch item up/down one semitone - affecs all items grouped with selected one if Grouping is ON

SWS: Pitch all takes up/down one semitone -- is independent of items grouping

In general native actions tend to be group sensitive while the SWS actions do not

The following ones don't create undo points and undoing them may produce inconsistent results.
Wrapping them inside a custom action seems to be a workround, it was tested with the last two.

-- 'View: Attach/unattach docker to/from main window' (40313) 

When the toggle state is ON it cannot be set to OFF if there're no visible dockers, its toggle state is linked to the state of the last docker to be attached/unattached with the option 'Attach docker to main window' (including a toolbar docker) and only such docker can be toggled using it, undocking a window by dragging doesn't set the action toggle state to OFF;

when there're no visible dockers and its toggle state is OFF, toggling it invokes the last toggled docker and changes the docker's attach state

The action toggle state is ON when there's no docker whose attach state was last toggled with it (which happens when windows were undocked by dragging) and when the toolbar docker is hidden, if the toolbar docker is visible in this scenario, the action toggle state is OFF

i.e. tracks in the Mixer can be arranged independently of their order in the Arrange window.

In this case in Arrange the new track will be inserted after whichever track that's currently the last in the Mixer

and which isn't necessarily the same as the last in Arrange.

Track: Go to previous track

from bottom to top, the track selected is the track previous to the last selected one (last touched)
from top to bottom, the track selected is the track previous to the first selected one (last touched)


!!!! Even though these actions select tracks, in essense what they change is the last touched track and work relative to the last touched track.

That's evident if after manual selection of a track you change the target track for insert/paste by clicking

on another track within Arrange while Prefs -> Editing behavior -> Mouse -> Mouse click/edit in arrange view: Sets track for insert/paste is enabled.

The next/previous track will be relative to the track you clicked the last even if the last clicked track isn't selected.


These two actions only work right away if there's an active last touched track (can be indicated by the bracket attached to the edit cursor). 

Last touched track is cleared with mouse click within Arrange below the last track.

So if there's no active last touched track these actions dosn't select a new track but BOTH make the very last track the last touched and select 

it if it's non-selected. A new track will only be selected and made the last touched on the next run provided the last touched track is still active.

To be able to record a video demo with sound and voiceover concurrently, add line rearoute_loopback=8 into the reaper.ini file in [REAPER] section. The number can vary. Then reload the program. The newly added inputs and outputs should be listed in the Audio Hardware Outputs list in the Master track routing window.
Then to record you use two projects side by side in different tabs, one for the demo, the second for voiceover recording. In the demo project Master track routing window add a loopback output while in the voiceover project add a new track and select a loopback input with the same number as the output in the demo project. Thus in the voiceover project you have two tracks, one is for voice and another is for audio coming from the demo project.

This may work out of the box provided 'Run background projects' option is enabled, but these additional outputs/inputs allow recording specific tracks without soloing them in the source project

May be irrelevant for the latest versions of REAPER

--------------------------------------------------------

Justin:

You can set rearoute_loopback=1 in your reaper.ini (right under [REAPER]), and then you will have loopback inputs and outputs which you can use to send between projects. (if you are on Windows, this will mean you lose ReaRoute capability, though, but you probably don't need it).

reaper.Undo_EndBlock("undo text", extraflags)

extraflags values


UNDO_STATE_ALL      = -1 OR 0xFFFFFFFF as per the specs https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/plugin/reaper_plugin.h (which probably doesn't matter much)
UNDO_STATE_TRACKCFG =  1 -- has track/master vol/pan/routing, ALL envelopes (master included)
UNDO_STATE_FX       =  2 -- track/master fx
UNDO_STATE_ITEMS    =  4 -- track items
UNDO_STATE_MISCCFG  =  8 -- loop selection, markers, regions, extensions!
UNDO_STATE_FREEZE   = 16 -- freeze state -- note that isfreeze is used independently, this is only used for the undo system to serialize the already frozen state


schwa:

Undo_BeginBlock will suppress REAPER creating any undo points until Undo_EndBlock is called. This allows the extension to perform more complex tasks that call in to multiple API functions that would ordinarily create undo points, without the overhead of creating individual points for what is effectively a single consolidated action.

The whichState parameter to the Undo_OnStateChange functions is a bitmask that is used with the UNDO_STATE_* flags that are declared in reaper_plugin.h. For example, if your extension changes both media items (perhaps by changing their length) and tracks (perhaps by adding a track), you might call Undo_OnStateChangeEx("text for undo point", UNDO_STATE_ITEMS|UNDO_STATE_TRACKCFG, -1).

If you want to create a new actions section (similar to the Main or MIDI sections), you must create a new KbdSectionInfo. However, you probably would only want to do that if you have created an entirely new context for these actions, such as a new dialog window similar to the MIDI editor or Media Explorer. If your actions are meant to be used in an existing context, such as the main arrange view or the MIDI editor, it would be easier to simply add the actions to the appropriate existing actions section.

The SWS source is usually the best place to look for hints on API questions. In fact, that's where I looked to see where the UNDO_STATE_* flags were published


https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=100849


schwa:

I'm not sure if this is fully documented (if not we'll add it), but the flag passed to Undo_EndBlock() controls how much of the project needs to be serialized for the undo point. -1 means "everything changed," so everything gets serialized, every track, media item, fx, the timeline, routing, and ARA state. As you've seen, serializing the ARA state may take a while -- this is completely out of REAPER's control, all we can do is ask the plugin for its state.

If you know that your script can only have affected certain parts of the project, you can pass that information as the flag argument to Undo_EndBlock which will make it much more efficient.
 
UNDO_STATE_ALL -1 OR 0xFFFFFFFF as per the specs https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/plugin/reaper_plugin.h (which probably doesn't matter much)
UNDO_STATE_TRACKCFG 1 // track/master vol/pan/routing, routing/hwout envelopes too
UNDO_STATE_FX 2 // track/master fx
UNDO_STATE_ITEMS 4 // track items
UNDO_STATE_MISCCFG 8 // loop selection, markers, regions, extensions
UNDO_STATE_FREEZE 16 // freeze state
UNDO_STATE_TRACKENV 32 // non-FX envelopes only
UNDO_STATE_FXENV 64 // FX envelopes, implied by UNDO_STATE_FX too
UNDO_STATE_POOLEDENVS 128 // contents of automation items -- not position, length, rate etc of automation items, which is part of envelope state
UNDO_STATE_FX_ARA 256 // ARA state

So if your script may have affected tracks and media items only but not FX, you could pass flag=5 (1+4) for example. If your script may have affected everything but freeze state, automation items and ARA state, you could pass flag=111 (1+2+4+8+32+64), etc.

To avoid forcing user to deal with ReaScript task control dialogue when there's
a defered function in the script, the defer function can be conditioned with external state
so it stops when the value changes at the next script run, e.g.

-- at the start of the script

reaper.SetExtState("section", "state", "OFF", false)


-- in the body of the script

local state = reaper.GetExtState("section", "state")
	if state == "ON" then
	reaper.defer(function())
	end

The next time the script is explicitly launched the defer function will stop. 
First run - defer is turned off, second run the script can be accessed, so it takes 2 steps.

ReaPack version numbers are not decimal (they're an infinite list of integer and alphabetic components). Because 2.1 from the previous PR is lower than 1.03, I renamed it to 2.4 for the update to be distributed.

While 2.11 is valid (higher than 2.4), releasing this will prevent any versions from 2.5 to 2.10 from being released as updates in the future. Patch updates should increment a third integer component: eg. 2.4.1.

Recording processed and raw input simultaneously with input FX

You could also set the track to 4 channels, then set REAPER to monitor a mono source, 
have the input fx chain copy the raw signal to 3/4, the processed signal to 1/2, 
and set the record mode to "record input (force multichannel)". 
This way you could record the processed and raw signals in the same (4 channel) file.

Green (GG) - low-order word.

Blue (BB) - high-order word.

 
The picture shows bytes in memory, in little-endian format, where the byte order is reverse than in hexadecimal representation (0xHHHHLLLL) and bit-shift operator names. 

The low-order word adds its exact value to the total value of the int. The high-order word adds its value multiplied by 0x10000 (left-shifted by 16 bits).

To store two values L and H into low-order and high-order word of integer value R, use this:

R = H<<16|L
or
R = MakeInt(L H)
 
To get low-order word and high-order word:

L = R&0xFFFF
H = R>>16


High-order byte, low-order byte

Sometimes some value can be stored in high-order byte and low-order byte of a word. Everything is similar as above.

To store two values L and H into low-order and high-order byte of word value R, use this:

R = H<<8|L

To get low-order byte and high-order byte:

L = R&0xFF

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(x & 0x0000FFFF) << 16 | (x & 0xFFFF0000) >> 16, here x is any decimal number. What does this expression mean?


This expression uses bit masking and bit shifting.

First (x & 0x0000FFFF) is a bitwise AND (&) of x and a mask value which is given in hexadecimal. Each digit of a hexadecimal number is 4 bits, so the fact that there are 8 digits tells you that this is a 32-bit value. F is the hex for the binary pattern 1111, so 0x0000FFFF is the binary value:

00000000000000001111111111111111

A logical AND has the property that the result contains a 1 wherever both the original operands have a 1 in a given position. Since the mask contains all 1s in the bottom 16 bits, this operation has the effect of ‘letting through’ the bottom 16 bits of x, while forcing the top 16 bits to be 0.

e.g.

0101101010010110 AND 
0000000011111111 = 
0000000010010110 

The other part of the expression:

(x & 0xFFFF0000) does the opposite - it selects the top 16 bits of x, and sets the bottom 16 bits to 0.

<< 16 is a leftwise shift by 16 binary places. >> 16 is a rightwise shift by 16 binary places.

A left or right shift is fairly self-explanatory - it just shifts the bits left or right. Bits that fall off the end are lost, and ‘new’ bits shifted in are set to 0.

So something like:

000110110 << 2 → 011011000

So in the original expression, having masked off the high 16 bits, they are shifted down to become the low 16 bits. And, the low 16 bits having been isolated are shifted up to the high 16 bits.

So after those two operations, the top 16 bits of x are now at the bottom, and the bottom 16 bits of x are now at the top.

All that remains is to recombine them into a single 32-bit value. That’s what the logical OR (|) operator does. A logical OR yields a 1 where either of the original operands are a 1. However, since all of the high 16 bits are a 0 in the first expression after the shift, and all of the low 16 bits are a 0 in the second expression after the shift, it simply copies the original bits unchanged to the result, effectively reglueing the two parts together.

So the result is that the high 16 bits end up in the low 16 bits, and the low 16 bits end up in the high 16 bits. The upper and lower 16 bits have swapped places.

So that’s what it does.

The bigger question of why it does this is unanswered. It’s possibly part of some bit-smooshing operation in cryptography or at least obfuscation. Very similar code is used to swap the endianness of values received over a network (big endian) to a little-endian processor (or vice versa), but in that case the values would be operated on in chunks of 8 bits, not 16 like this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A mask defines which bits you want to keep, and which bits you want to clear.

Masking is the act of applying a mask to a value. This is accomplished by doing:

Bitwise ANDing in order to extract a subset of the bits in the value
Bitwise ORing in order to set a subset of the bits in the value
Bitwise XORing in order to toggle a subset of the bits in the value
Below is an example of extracting a subset of the bits in the value:

Mask:   00001111b
Value:  01010101b

Applying the mask to the value means that we want to clear the first (higher) 4 bits, and keep the last (lower) 4 bits. Thus we have extracted the lower 4 bits. The result is:

Mask:   00001111b
Value:  01010101b
Result: 00000101b

Masking is implemented using AND, so in C we get:

uint8_t stuff(...) {
  uint8_t mask = 0x0f;   // 00001111b
  uint8_t value = 0x55;  // 01010101b
  return mask & value;
}

Here is a fairly common use-case: Extracting individual bytes from a larger word. We define the high-order bits in the word as the first byte. We use two operators for this, &, and >> (shift right). This is how we can extract the four bytes from a 32-bit integer:

void more_stuff(uint32_t value) {             // Example value: 0x01020304
    uint32_t byte1 = (value >> 24);           // 0x01020304 >> 24 is 0x01 so
                                              // no masking is necessary
    uint32_t byte2 = (value >> 16) & 0xff;    // 0x01020304 >> 16 is 0x0102 so
                                              // we must mask to get 0x02
    uint32_t byte3 = (value >> 8)  & 0xff;    // 0x01020304 >> 8 is 0x010203 so
                                              // we must mask to get 0x03
    uint32_t byte4 = value & 0xff;            // here we only mask, no shifting
                                              // is necessary
    ...
}

Notice that you could switch the order of the operators above, you could first do the mask, then the shift. The results are the same, but now you would have to use a different mask:

uint32_t byte3 = (value & 0xff00) >> 8;


We are doing AND operation in this example. There are also other masking operators- OR, XOR.

Bit-Masking means imposing mask over bits. Here is a bit-masking with AND-

     1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1   [input]
(&)  0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0    [mask]
------------------------------
     0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0  [output]

So, only the middle 4 bits (as these bits are 1 in this mask) remain.

Lets see this with XOR-

     1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1   [input]
(^)  0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0    [mask]
------------------------------
     1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1  [output]

Now, the middle 4 bits are flipped (1 became 0, 0 became 1).

So, using bit-mask we can access individual bits [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47981/how-do-you-set-clear-and-toggle-a-single-bit]. 

Sometimes, this technique may also be used for improving performance. Take this for example-

bool isOdd(int i) {
    return i%2;
}

This function tells if an integer is odd/even. We can achieve the same result with more efficiency using bit-mask-

bool isOdd(int i) {
    return i&1;
}

Short Explanation: If the least significant bit of a binary number is 1 then it is odd (https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/leastsb.htm); 

for 0 it will be even. So, by doing AND with 1 we are removing all other bits except for the least significant bit i.e.:

     55  ->  0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1   [input]
(&)   1  ->  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1    [mask]
---------------------------------------
      1  <-  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  [output]


Also, to convert an integer to an odd no. if it is an even number: i=i|1. 

This comes in handy when we are trying to generate a sequence like 1, 3, 5,..., 2, 4, 6,...

You can also use the following operation to find the number with only the least significant bit from an integer: lsb = i&-i


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10493411/what-is-bit-masking

Each hexadecimal digit stands for four bits.

To convert the hex number 0XFFFF to decimal (or any other hexadecimal number for that matter), you follow these steps:

Step 1) Multiply the last digit by 1, Multiply the second to last digit by 16, Multiply the third to the last digit by 16 x 16, Multiply the fourth to the last digit by 16 x 16 x 16, Multiply the fifth to the last digit by 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 and so on until all the digits are used.

Step 2) Add up all the products you got from Step 1 to get the answer to 0XFFFF in decimal.

Here is the math using using the steps above showing you how to convert 0XFFFF to decimal.

F x 1 = 15
F x 16 = 240
F x 16 x 16 = 3840
F x 16 x 16 x 16 = 61440

15 + 240 + 3840 + 61440 = 65535

-- Automatic cutting up takes with empty items during recording / auto-punch with loop and context (pre/post-roll)

Automatic cutting up! :)

Say you know that your audio/midi performance should only play on bars 4-8 before you record it. But you also know, that you need to start playing/listening before bar 4 and your last note/input will continue after bar 8.

Then you put an empty item on the track (to which recording is being done).

Now, if you record something from bars 1-12 on that track, it will be broken up into three items: 1->4, 4->8, and 8->12. This would make deleting the areas outside of 4->8 only a few clicks.

Personally, I think it's easier/better to do this editing after the fact for most use-cases. One workflow where this would be useful is if you're recording yourself with a loop of the section you're working on. You could:

    Put a loop from the point you need to start listening to the point where you'll be ready for another pass.
    Put an empty item roughly where the actual take will happen (inside the loop area).
    Now you can hit record, walk away from the computer and do as many takes as you need.
    When you get back, it will be trivial to remove any noise in the pre/post-roll sections.

Again, this is very niche, but it is a valid workflow. In most cases, it's probably faster to edit manually, but it might be useful in some scenarios where things are off-grid.

(Caveat: I'm assuming the default Reaper behaviour)

-- ashcat_lt ReaComp transparent RMS buss compression technique

https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=156201


I've been using a technique lately for a very transparent kind of volume leveling. 

It works well for vocals (a lot like that VocalRider plugin, I think), 
but I also do it right on the Master to get a bit more "loudness" without 
losing so much transient information.
The trick is to set the RMS window pretty big, but then set the pre-comp 
to somewhere around half the RMS window. This way, the compressor is reacting 
to the average level around the current sample - both past and future - so that 
if one bear is significantly louder than the next, it sort of gently 
dips the volume leading into the louder hit, and then comes back up afterwards 
in a pretty natural way. Attack and release are basically built into the process, 
so I'll set those parameters to 0, and I usually use a very low ratio - 1.1 or 1.2. 
Then, for even greater transparency, I'll usually set the threshold so that it just 
barely starts squishing on some of the louder parts, and then crank the knee where 
up so that it's almost always doing just a tiny bit, but it's almost always in the 
knee, and almost never hits the full ratio. I sometimes try to calculate the time 
constants to cover a beat or two of the song's tempo, but I've found that it's not 
super critical, as long as it's pretty long. Pre-comp only goes to 250ms, I think, 
so that limits things a little. All of the really fast transients still get through 
with the same proportional relationship compared to what's going on around them, 
but the overall dynamic range is reduced very transparently.


Edit - it's worth at least mentioning that the RMS level of anything that's not 
a square wave is always less than its peak level. At least to a certain point, 
the longer you set the RMS window, the lower the level that hits the detector and shows 
on the meter, and the lower the threshold needed to get the same amount of gain reduction. 
It can be kind of tough to A/B different RMS sizes, or even say for sure where any 
perceived differences are coming from.

I also use it with all time constants at zero as a variable-slope clipper. It's so darn 
versatile, even without side-chaining and pre/post EQ finagling.

Just grab some mix, remove any compression/limiting you've got on the Master, 
stick in ReaComp and go for it.

I've found that by shelving down the low end just a bit before the slow gooey prescient 
comp, and then shelving back up on the other end, I'm getting some almost scary dynamics 
while pushing crest factors up to -12dbfs and more. In fact, I'm worried that I might 
be overdoing things, but it just sounds so damn good!

Edit -
Also, when I'm doing this slow thing, I set attack and release to 0 because they're 
essentially redundant and in fact work against what i'm trying to acheive. Basically, 
the relationship of the pre-comp to the RMS time determines your attack/release 
times, but you can push your attacks to start before the transients. When pre-comp is 
exactly half of RMS, then it is applying maximum gain reduction exactly when it is loudest, 
it heads down a little early, and comes back a little late, and it lets anything fast that 
happens kind of just sail on through. If pre-comp is a little less than half, then it's 
a little more like a traditional attack/release, in that it reaches maximum crush a little 
late. Going the other way is like having a very timid soundguy anticipating your moves and 
turning down the fader when it looks like your going to get loud.


Example settings:

Comp 1: pre-comp 250, attack/release 0, ratio 1.2, knee size 24 db, lowpass 20000, highpass 0, RMS size 509.8, thresh -13.1
Comp 2: pre-comp 50, attack/release 0, ratio 2.6, knee size 6.3 db, lowpass 20000, highpass 0, RMS size 105, thresh -10
Comp 3: pre-comp 5, attack/release 0, ratio 5.9, knee size 6.3 db, lowpass 20000, highpass 0, RMS size 10.8, thresh -8.3

Those three comps were in series on the Master. Slow faster fastest. Each a little harder 
but at a higher threshold. Don't remember what it was from. I might regret it now, and don't 
much use that arrangement anymore. Nowadays it's mostly just the first really slow one with 
preemphasis/deemphasis from ReaEQ on either side followed by a saturator.


whiteaxxxe's example settings: precomp 250ms, RMS size 500ms, attack & release 0, threshold to taste.

-- To place sub-project in its own folder with a custom name


Specify a secondary recording path (must be full) in the Project settings and select 'Secondary only' 
under 'Record to audio path' in the Track Recording settings. 
But for each new file you'll have to update the path in the Project settings.

The effective Track Recording settings path is the one set for the uppermost track if several are selected

Secondary recording path is independent of the primary

Subproject file name convention is defined at Preferences -> Recording -> Filename format for recorded files


In fact all this may be overkill. If you set Preferences -> Recording -> Filename format to $trackslashes and 

name your topmost selected track say subproject/one a subproject one.rpp will be crated in folder \subproject.

The name can be formatted differently with wildcards. With the said track named subproject/ and name format 

being $trackslashes$datetime the subproject named after the current date and time will be created in folder \subproject

If primary media path is set in the Project settings, that's where the subproject folder will be placed under.

MIDI Editor 32060: RS7d3c_9de8cea86eb5a13361c01d1f0ae1d5f86c998101 -- infix is 7d3c_ (7d3c is 32060 in hexadecimal)

This is also reflected in the .ini files

The numeric command IDs from different sections differ by the last digit 

The difference between commandIDs of the Main and MIDI Editor sections is exactly 1, e.g.

56614 and 56613 of which the one stemming from the Main section is greater

But only if REAPER starts with both of them present. If one is installed while REAPER is already running

then it's assigned what's presumably the first availabe numeric commandID which sticks until restart.

When a script is deleted, its entry is removed from reaper-kb.ini, but is still cached within REAPER

and not recognized until restart.

At the same time NamedCommandLookup() using named commandID of the MIDI Editor instance of the script 

from which the infix has been stripped DOES return Main section numeric commandID even if there's no script in there.

The same is true for ReverseNamedCommandLookup() but it's less useful because numeric relationships between 

commandIDs of instances in different section are not so obvious

About the new TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(), TrackFX_GetNamedConfigParm(), TakeFX_SetNamedConfigParm(), and TakeFX_GetNamedConfigParm() APIs:

These are designed to allow setting/getting plug-in specific parameters that are not exposed as normal VST-style parameters. The first use of this is for ReaSamplomatic5k, to allow getting/setting the list of sample files.

Lua examples:

ok, fn = reaper.TrackFX_GetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "FILE0") -- get first sample filename
ok, fn2 = reaper.TrackFX_GetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "FILE1") -- get second sample filename


ok = reaper.TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "FILE0", fn) -- set first sample filename
ok = reaper.TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "FILE1", fn2) -- set second sample filename -- note that FILE0 must exist before you can set FILE1, etc.

ok = reaper.TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "-FILE0", "") -- remove first sample (second sample becomes first sample)

ok = reaper.TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "+FILE0", fn) -- insert sample (old FILE0 becomes FILE1)

ok = reaper.TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "-FILE*", "") -- remove all samples


-- Finally, when the script is finished updating the samples, it should call (this will trigger actually loading the samples from disk, adding an undo point, etc):
reaper.TrackFX_SetNamedConfigParm(track,fx, "DONE","")
If other REAPER plug-ins have parameters that you'd like having script access to, let me know. I suppose having this for JSFX filename-parameters would be handy too.

-- FX local to project

JS per-project are JS found in /project_path/Effects
So if you want to give someone a project with some custom FX, you can 
(and they won't have to install them).


If a local JSFX file becomes unavailable during the session, REAPER reuses a file with the same FX name
from the \Effects directory, if any, when the unavailable JSFX is loaded from the FX Browser


If you don't want to install the JS library

Go to Program Files\REAPER\InstallData, rename or delete the Effects directory, 
and create an empty file named "Effects". This will prevent the installer from writing 
to this path (and REAPER won't try to replace your AppData Effects directory with the file).

JSFX local to project are only displayed in the FX browser if the project is saved and they aren't listed in reaper-jsfx.ini

JS: <Project>/ReaperBlog_Macro Controller test.jsfx // local JSFX name displayed in the FX chain

The format of local JSFX preset file name in the REAPER /presets folder is js-_Project__(JSFX file name).ini

So in order for a local JSFX to load presets saved using its regular version the original preset file must be duplicated 

and renamed to match the abovementioned format

there are two kinds of command IDs. The built-in actions have 
a fixed numeric ID which can be directly used. 
Extension plugin, custom and script actions are identified 
by a "named command ID" (for scripts it's a hash derived from the path). 
These actions also have an underlying numeric ID but, 
because it's determined at runtime, it's not guaranteed to always be the same.

A named command ID must be converted to its current underlying 
numeric ID using NamedCommandLookup before being able to run 
the script using Main_OnCommand or an external program like 
AutoHotkey posting a WM_COMMAND message.

The logic seems to be as follows: by double click FX from the FX browser are added 
to the track which was selected at the moment the FX browser was opened. It remembers 
the track and ignores any other currently selected tracks.

When the FX browser is opened with all tracks deselected it's linked to the track 
which was touched last.

If you open the FX browser in a floating window you'll see that there's a track number 
displayed in its top bar. That's the track it's currently linked to.

And even if you manage to open the FX browser so it's not linked to any track and when 
instead of the track number 'Browse FX' title is displayed in its top bar, double click 
on an FX entry doesn't do anything regardless of track selection.

Parameter modulation, like any FX parameter move (including moving a knob on the GUI or moving a physical controller), is sent once per buffer block, that's unfortunately not something that anybody can change. Well-designed plugins will interpolate parameter moves internally to avoid zippering, for example if a filter plugin advertises "smooth sweeps" that's what they mean. For volume and pan parameter modulation, JS/utility/volume_pan does internal smoothing.

If you have a plugin that you want to modulate but you hear zipper noise, you will need to lower the buffer size.

You can also render them out via Render dialogue having set 'Channels:' menu to 8 and 'Source:' menu to 'Master mix'. 
But first set the Master track to 8 channels and in I/O preferences under 'Parent channels:' of each of the 8 tracks to be rendered 
choose a different mono channel.

If 'Selected track (stems)' instead of 'Master mix' is selected in 'Source:' menu, 'Channels:' menu must be set to the track channel count, i.e. 8

-- Observations on overlapping items in lanes, 
-- irrelevant for builds 6.54 and onward (https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=267390)


Within track chunk chunks of overlapping items aren't listed in ascending order of their IIDs as they are displayed in lanes, but according to their global 

relative position expressed as IP_ITEMNUMBER parameter value of GetMediaItemInfo_Value() function and returned as the iterator value in items loop.


Both actions (discontinued since 6.54)

Item lanes: Move item down one lane (when showing overlapping items in lanes)

Item lanes: Move item up one lane (when showing overlapping items in lanes)

when first applied cause actual IIDs in overlapping items change from none to the number of such items less 1, i.e. nil, 1, 2, 3 etc, regardless of the direction

and the actual item they're applied to, the sequence is initialized from top to bottom

different clusters of overlapping items can have identical IID sequences which doesn't cause conflict

they can also co-exist with identically IID indexed non-overlapping items

item numbers (IP_ITEMNUMBER) within track do not match their IIDs, neither in values nor in order of their sequence,

applying the above actions doesn't change IP_ITEMNUMBER values


Within track chunk chunks of overlapping items aren't listed in ascending order of their IIDs as they are displayed in lanes, but according to their global 

relative position expressed as IP_ITEMNUMBER parameter value of GetMediaItemInfo_Value() function and returned as the iterator value in items loop. 


What governs the order of overlapping items with identical IIDs i couldn't figure out (maybe their actual IDs). What governs on the track the order of 

overlapping items with identical start and end coordinates (not their vertical order when they're displayed in lanes) i couldn't figure out either. It may be 

linked to their pointers.


When overlapping items with identical IIDs from the same cluster are manipulated (shifted, trimmed etc.) their order in lanes changes if the change affects their 

order within track.


When imploding while the lanes are collapsed the logic of item ordering within track isn't clear, it's difficult to predict which item will end up being the 

outermost (visible).


When copying an item with IID, the IID of the copy only changes if the copy's start or end coordinates differ from the source item, if an item is copied and 

immediately pasted over itself so that two instances overlap, the copy's IID doesn't change. If the source item didn't have IID because of being the 1st of the 

overlapping items (as happens after applying the above native actions), for the copy pasted over it the IID is autogenerated following the global sequence


When overlapping item lanes are collapsed, the visible item is the one whose chunk is the last in the sequence of the overlapping items cluster inside the track 

chunk. Overlapping item lanes are collapsed when I_LASTY values of all the items in the cluster are <= 15 which is true for builds prior to 6.54: 

1) at certain TCP height while 'Maximum number of lanes when showing overlapping items in lanes' option value at Preferences -> Appearance option is set to be 
equal or greater than the actual number of mutually overlapping items, 

2) when this value is set to 1 and for builds prior to 6.54 

3) when Preferences -> Appearance -> Media Item Positioning -> Offset by is set to 0


Copying overlapping items, re-ordered either by actions or by this script, doesn't keep the same order for the copies, instead they're reordered according to 

items order on the track and within the track chunk. https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=265287

-- reaper-jsfx.ini


The file seems to list ALL JSFX

REV entries in my file are fewer than the NAME entries by 3, 

because 2 NAME entries point to non-existent files and therefore only contain path, 

without the name (which helps to identify them), the 3d one references 

a non-JSFX txt file which doesn't have desc: tag.

These 3 odd NAME entries are the last in the NAME entries list, 

don't follow the alphabetic order of preceding NAME entries and instead 

alphabetically sorted among themselves.

So REV entries apparently only apply to files which exist and contain desc: tag.

Changes to JSFX names made in the NAME entries inside the file is reflected in the FX browser

Q: I'd like to have a reverb which adjusts the room size depending on the panning, with central pan=small room, 

100% right or left, big room. I know I can link parameters with click->parameter->link from midi or fx parameter, 

but that won't work as it will make the room small when we are panned to the left, medium in the middle and big in th right, 

which is not what I want.

I would need the room size parameter (S) to be linked to the pan one (P) through the function S=|P|+ c, 

with c being the value of the room with central panning, which I can decide.


A: Create a JS plugin with two parameters. Parameter one will be linked to whatever is generating the LFO value. 

The JS is taking this value and calculating the function, with the result going to parameter two. 

Link parameter two to the relevant parameter on your reverb. Very handy technique for one-off interoperability.

1. Trim/Read - allows previewing and trimming the envelope by moving/affecting the control of the parameter being automated without affecting the actual curve, so effectively changing envelope Base parameter available also in automation item properties.
When activated, the control setting is transfered to the envelope while the control itself is reset, which allows trimming.
During playback the control of the automated parameter doesn't follow the envelope's existing curve.

2. Read - In playback the control of the automated parameter follows the envelope's existing curve.

3. Touch - allows punching in envelope change by moving/affecting the control of the parameter being automated.
Only applies change for as long as it's being effected by the user, otherwise simply follows the envelope's existing curve.

4. Latch - allows writing envelope curve by moving/affecting the control of the parameter being automated.
Once effected by the user continues writing envelope even without user interference until transport is stopped.
If during playback the control of the automated parameter isn't affected by the user, it simply follows the envelope's existing curve.

5.Latch preview - doesn't write an envelope curve, only allows previwing how changing the setting of the parameter being automated affects the output.
If during playback the control of the automated parameter isn't affected by the user, it simply follows the envelope's existing curve.

Round-robin with multiple velocities


If you have 8 velocities and 6 hits per velocity, loading 48 samples into one instance of RS5k 

is still the wrong way to do it. RS5k will take those 48 samples and use them as 48 different velocities. 

Try playing 6 consecutive hits at the same velocity and it will always play the same sample.

It's a bit counter intuitive but you need to take those 48 samples and divide them in 6 groups made of 8 samples 

of different velocities. Something like this:

Group 1: Hardest 1, Hard 1, regular 1,Soft 1, softest 1, ghost 1... (8 samples per group)

Group 2: Hardest 2, Hard 2, regular 2,Soft 2, softest 2, ghost 2...

...

Group 6: Hardest 6, Hard 6, regular 6,Soft 6, softest 6, ghost 6...

Then you need to load 6 instances of RS5k on the same track, one for every group, and activate the round robin button 

in every instance of the plugin. Then set the probability from 1/6 in the first instance, then 1/5 and so on until 1 

in the final instance of RS5K in the track. Also, every instance of RS5k has to have the "remove played notes from midi stream" ON.

-- Automate velocity

The problem is that MIDI velocity isn't a continuous controller. 

They are individual MIDI events that accompany the note.

What you want to do is insert JS: MIDI Velocity Control as the first FX before your virtual instrument. 

We are going to abuse the crap out of this JS' ability to modify incoming MIDI.

You want to show track envelopes for Min Velocity and Max Velocity. See where we're heading?

Now you've got automatable track envelopes. 

What you want to do is make both Min and Max Velocity envelopes identical. 

The value they share is the value the velocity will be forced into.

If there is a gap between values, if the original velocity is less than the minimum, 

it becomes the minimum, and if the original velocity is greater than the maximum, 

it becomes the maximum, and if the original value is inbetween, it does not change. 

So you must give JS: MIDI Velocity Control no choice.

Steps:

2) Right click on any of the tabs and enable the following
'Run background projects'
'Run stopped background projects'
'Play stopped background projects with active project'
'Synchronize play times w/play background projects'
3) Hit play and both projects should be running.

Notes: The important thing to remember is that backround projects are any projects other than
the currently selected/active project. So if you switch to a different tab.., the previous tab automaticaly becomes a background project.

'Play stopped background projects with active project': --- What this does, is it allows all projects to share some of the transport buttons
(Play, Stop, Go to start, Go to end).., for some reason the pause button is not shared.
If this is turned off only the active project will start when you press play.., but you can still switch tabs and then press play again
and that project will also start to play.

'Synchronize play times w/play background projects': So what this does, is it syncs the play start positions of all projects with the
currently active project. If for example your play cursor is at 2.1.00 in the active project when you press play all background projects
will also start from this time.


For live input or VST instruments you'll want to do the same thing.., except you won't need to hit play unless you're using a plugin that requires it.

One of the cool things to remember is that each project can be set to different BPM and PlayRates.

Oh..., one other thing, if you want to record what is comming out of all playing projects, you can use the command "Save live output to disk(bounce)' found under the File menu or actions list. In the dialog window that opens, you'll probably what to enable the option 'Stop saving output on first stop'.., this will stop the recording when you click on the transport stop button.

not many are aware of that the Volume (Pre-FX) automation affects MIDI velocity as well. So you could do the same with a pre-FX volume envelope and no MIDI FX on the track. It's a bit weird because you have dB values, not percentage but it's ok to work with nevertheless. I am just sometimes too lazy to create the MIDI FX and go this way.

Track > Envelopes > Toggle volume (pre-FX) active. This now puts an envelope on your MIDI track that can be edited like a regular envelope, but controls the MIDI velocity, thereby retaining any dynamics in your VSTi instrument samples!

-- Cursors - jsader


The numbers for standard Windows cursor can be found here: LoadCursor function.

The list of REAPER's custom cursors are here: Custom Cursors. This list is outdated though, and doesn't include recent additions such as notation key signature cursors.

The numbers in this list are also misleading. The IDs that you use for setcursor are 105 for adjustfade, then 182-191 for some others, etc. (Thanks to cfillion and Xenakios for telling me this recently. They also referred me to Resource Hacker to find all the actual IDs.) I don't know all the correct IDs yet.

The first time that you use a certain string as the second parameter in the function (even an empty string, AFAIK), that string becomes the user-specified "name" for the cursor number. Next time you use that string, it will override whatever number you used. I think that name will remain in memory until you restart REAPER.

For example, if you run gfx.setcursor(182, "dragdrop"), you can later load the cursor again using a dummy number such as gfx.setcursor(1, "dragdrop"). But if you try gfx.setcursor(183, "dragdrop"), it will also override 183 and load dragdrop instead.

This may get confusing, so it may be better to stick with numbers gfx.setcursor(n, tostring(n)).

EDIT: Other IDs for cursors are 417-420, 429-434, 450, 453, 460-465, 472, 473, 488, 502-503, 515, 517, 525-535, and 1009-1011.

-- IF and IF NOT statements for regular custom actions

Actions to be used are named 'Action: Skip next action ...'

Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid -- mousewwheel in, skip next, run action B
-- action A
Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid -- mousewwheel out, skip next, run action A
-- action B

useful to dictate action depending on the mouse wheel direction

if each alternative action is comprised of several individual actions, each must be preceded with 'Action: Skip next ...' action, e.g.


Custom: Shift time selection by grid (map to mousewheel - out = right, in = left)
  ------------------------------------------------------------ alternative 1
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Go to start of time selection
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  View: Move cursor right to grid division
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Time selection: Set start point
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Go to end of time selection
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  View: Move cursor right to grid division
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Time selection: Set end point
  ------------------------------------------------------------ alternative 2
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Go to start of time selection
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  View: Move cursor left to grid division
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Time selection: Set start point
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Go to end of time selection
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  View: Move cursor left to grid division
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Time selection: Set end point


The action 
Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action toggle state enabled, -1 if disabled, 0 if toggle state unavailable.
can be used to detect toggle state and set CC param to refer to downstream with another 'Action: Skip next action ...'

Custom: REAPERMania_Seek by clicking the item during playback (assign to mouse modifier)
  Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action toggle state enabled, -1 if disabled, 0 if toggle state unavailable.
  Transport: Play <------------------------------------------ the action reports toggle state, single skip, see next custom action example
  View: Move edit cusor to mouse cursor
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <=0/mid
  Transport: Play


Custom: Toggle alternate M shortcut
  Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action toggle state enabled, -1 if disabled, 0 if toggle state unavailable.
  SWS/S&M: Dummy toggle 1 <------------------------------------ can be toggled from a toolbar or a menu item
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Markers: Insert marker at current position <----------------- the action doesn't report toggle state therefore is preceded with 2 modifier actions, double skip
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Track: Toggle mute for selected tracks


Custom: Toggle alternate M shortcut
  Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action armed, 0 otherwise.
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid <----------------- any action can be used for arming as long as it itself doesn't perform a specific action, can be  armed from a toolbar button, toggle actions cannot be armed
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Markers: Insert marker at current position
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter ==0/mid
  Track: Toggle mute for selected tracks

Still conditioning behavior on a toggle state is preferable over armed state because armed state hinders free usage of Arrange

Custom: Toggle alternate M shortcut (proof of concept) -- activate 'Toggle show track icons in mixer' from toolbar button
  Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action toggle state enabled, -1 if disabled, 0 if toggle state unavailable.
  Mixer: Toggle show track icons in mixer <--------------------- conditional toggle action, seem pretty innocuous setting which doesn't interfere with the workflow
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Markers: Insert marker at current position
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Track: Toggle mute for selected tracks

-- In the following custom action the toggle state is automatically set to Off once the action which depends on its being On has been executed
-- If a series of actions depend on the toggle state each must be preceded with the corresponding 'Skip next action' action

Custom: Toggle alternate M shortcut MOMENTARY (proof of concept) -- activate 'Toggle show track icons in mixer' from toolbar button
  Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action toggle state enabled, -1 if disabled, 0 if toggle state unavailable.
  Mixer: Toggle show track icons in mixer <--------------------- conditional toggle action
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid
  Markers: Insert marker at current position
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Track: Toggle mute for selected tracks
  Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <0/mid
  Mixer: Toggle show track icons in mixer

-- as native dummy toggle actions the following can be used linked to a toolbar button because they don't alter behavior drastically
-- and in a way which may militate against the workflow or playback or layout/appearance

View: Toggle transport visible
View: Toggle show/hide item labels
View: Toggle show media cues in items
View: Toggle master track visible
View: Toggle displaying labels above/within media items
View: Toggle auto-view-scroll while recording

Transport: Toggle preserve pitch in audio items when changing master playrate
Track: Toggle show/hide in mixer
Track: Toggle all track grouping enabled
Toggle external timecode synchronization

Mixer: Toggle tracks with receives in mixer
Mixer: Toggle show track icons in mixer
Mixer: Toggle show icons for the last track in a folder
Options: Show FX inserts in TCP (when size permits)

-- Bypass an action

There's a way to bypass an action, however for a sequence of actions it's quite ungainly 
unless such sequence is converted into another custom action and used as such


Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action armed, 0 otherwise
-- YOUR ACTION TO BYPASS
Action: Skip next action if CC parameter ==0/mid
-- YOUR ACTION TO BYPASS

First you set CC parameter to 0 based on the state of your action (it must not be armed) and skip it 
and then you skip it based on the CC parameter just set. With many actions you'd need to replicate this 
sequence for each action that needs bypassing because only one action can be skipped at a time.

Bypass can also be conditioned by another toggle action, e.g.

Action: Skip next action, set CC parameter to relative +1 if action toggle state enabled, -1 if disabled, 0 if toggle state unavailable.
-- TOGGLE ACTION
Action: Skip next action if CC parameter >0/mid OR  <0/mid ---------- depeding on which toggle state is required as a condition
-- YOUR ACTION TO BYPASS

-- Smooth scrolling

https://old.reddit.com/r/Reaper/comments/10f4whe/found_a_workaround_for_smooth_scrolling/

Add: Action: Modify MIDI CC/mousewheel: 0.5x
Add this multiple times, I've got 6 of it: View: Scroll vertically (MIDI CC relative/mousewheel)

With this action you have twice the steps, and to me it's enough to keep me oriented. 
It also scrolls 3 times as far which some times is too much, so I use shift + scroll for this action and ctrl + shift + scroll for fine scrolling.

I made the fine scrolling action so that it scrolls about 80% of the view, 
so that if your vertically zoomed in to the max and scroll to see the automation lane of a track, 
you still see the bottom 20% of the track.

Add: 
Action: Modify MIDI CC/mousewheel: 0.5x
Action: Modify MIDI CC/mousewheel: -10%
Action: Modify MIDI CC/mousewheel: -10%
Action: Modify MIDI CC/mousewheel: -10%

The problem was Modulation can only be linked from 'knob' sources, so we need a FX that actually shows randomized value.

2. Put MIDI Note Randomize, select the same note as the one populated with note events in the MIDI item, it will generate random notes
3. Put MIDI Note Examiner, it shows MIDI note info on its 'knobs', this is needed for creating random slider movements
4. Put some FX to be modulated
5. Link plugin control to MIDI Examiner Data Byte 1 parameter via parameter modulation

The tool sets the length to the next larger grid size, so a 1/128 note length can be set
to any length, but say a 1/16 note cannot be set to any smaller size because
it already covers then (i.e. 1/32, 1/64, 1/128 are included in 1/16).

The tool remembers the initial note size so after extending a 1/128 note with while the tool is open
its 1/128 size can still be restored

To set a note length to grid size use action 'Edit: Set note lengths to grid size' after setting grid size

-- Compressing and expanding MIDI velocities and CC automation

1. Select events

2. Open Event Properties dialogue

3a. To compress:

In the Value field use either division operator / with values greater than 1 or multiplication operator * with values lesser than 1

When all values are decreased by e.g. half the difference between then is halved as well,

e.g. 100 vs 50, 100 - 50 = 50 -- diff

after halving: 50 vs 25, 50 - 25 = 25 -- diff

Then they can be increased together with + operator to raise the overal volume

3b. To expand:

In the Value field use either division operator / with values lesser than 1 or multiplication operator * with values greater than 1

e.g. 50 vs 25, 50 - 25 = 25 -- diff

after doubling: 100 vs 50, 100 - 50 = 50 -- diff

Then they can be decreased together with - operator to lower the overal volume

is passed as theme_file_path argument in the above function

And after doing some search found out that SWS extension already offers this feature as actions

Options: New recording creates new media items

-- Creating a tempo map

1) make sure to have a simple shortcut for the action "insert marker at play cursor"
2) play the song and tap along with every bar (or half note, or quarter note, depending on how fine you want the tempo map to be)
3) zoom in and match markers with transients if necessary (the more accurately you tapped, the less there is to do here)
4) go to the menu bar and look for "Extensions -> Tempo -> Convert project markers to tempo markers..."
5) set the correct time signature, indicate how many markers count for a measure (depending on 2), check "Remove project markers", and press "Convert"
This will not only create a tempo map as in the video, but also add stretch markers to all items which give the flexibility to move items around and quantize them to the grid. This is useful when trying to sketch out a song from fragments of a jam session that was recorded without a click. Unfortunately, the process is just as tedious as in the video. Wish there was an easier way to do this.

You can select the number of voices you want to play simultaneously in ReaVoice.

There will likely be a strange, slight delay before ReaVoice starts to generate the intended result. I suggest resampling/recording

-- Way to temporarily change and toggle mouse modifiers config since REAPER 7
-- instead of deprecated 'Set default mouse modifier action for...' actions

The intended replacement for the deprecated actions is to create a simple reascript. 
For example the deprecated action 'Set default mouse modifier for media item left drag 
to move item contents ignoring snap' can be replaced with this reascript:

reaper.SetMouseModifier("Media item left drag", 0, "Move item contents ignoring snap")

Benefits: you can set as many modifiers as you want in the same reascript, you can do other things 
in the reascript too, you can set non-default (shift, control, shift+control, etc) modifiers 
just as easily, but most importantly the system doesn't require us adding a zillion more actions 
every time we add support for new mouse modifiers.

...the behavior is complex!

In general, existing envelope points that exist outside of automation items are hidden if you then enable "bypass envelope outside of automation items", regardless of whether or not the envelope is displayed in its own lane. Toggling that option doesn't create new automation items.

When envelopes are displayed in their own lanes by default, and envelopes are bypassed outside of automation items, activating a new envelope does not automatically create an automation item on the envelope, because it's obvious the new envelope exists.

When envelopes are not displayed in their own lanes by default, and envelopes are bypassed outside of automation items, you have a problem when you activate a brand-new envelope: you have no way to see that the envelope exists. The option "Options: Automatically insert automation item when activating envelope that is bypassed outside of automation items and not displayed in envelope lane" exists to handle that problem, by automatically inserting an automation item in the media lane when you create a new envelope in that situation.

-- Changing some of the theme's fonts via Theme Development settings

Open Theme Development settings with the action Theme development: Show theme tweak/configuration window, search for font

You'll find 16 'WALTER font' slots, some are already taken, most are not.

In the theme's rtconfig.txt file locate section

; ----------------- WALTER -------------------
; font #1 - MCP Track Numbers

; font #2 - Extended Mixer

; font #3 - Transport Selection

; font #4 - Envcp labels

; font #5 - Transport Rate

; font #6 - Extended Mixer - Large layouts
; -------------------------------------------

This section only serves as a reminder what is what because it's commented out.

These font numbers correspond to WALTER font slots in the Theme Development settings
and are assigned to UI elements inside the code, e.g. trans.rate.font (#5), trans.sel.font (#3),
tcp.fxparm.font (#2) as of v5 default theme. So in the rtconfig.txt file you search for any
elements which end with '.font' and collate their font setting with the reminder list above.
SInce there're 16 WALTER font slots and only 6 are enganed by default, the non-engaged slots can
be linked to other elements or used to changed the font setting without affecting the original
WALTER font slot setting.

based on White Tie's suggestions:

Make one of your theme editor 'WALTER font' settings into a big bold fella, 
then set its number for 'trans.bpm.edit.font' within your theme's WALTER.

https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=131790#4

ReaEQ 1
ReaGate 1
ReaEQ 2
ReaGate 2
ReaEQ 3
ReaGate 3
JS: Volume/Pan Smoother

2. Set their routing under '2 in 2 out' button as follows:

ReaEQ 1 - 1/2 -> 3/4
ReaGate 1 - 3/4 -> 3/4

ReaEQ 2 - 1/2 -> 5/6
ReaGate 2 - 5/6 -> 5/6

ReaGate 3 - 7/8 -> 7/8

JS: Volume/Pan Smoother - 3/4 -> 1/2, 5/6 -> 1/2, 7/8 -> 1/2

3. Configure these plugins as follows:

----- Kick band
ReaEQ 1 - One tab, Type: Low pass, Frequency: 150, Bandwidth: 0.88
ReaGate 1 - Threshold -6 dB, Send MIDI on open/close enabled, note: 60, the rest is default

----- Snare band
ReaEQ 2 - Tab 1, Type: Band, Frequency: 1400, Gain: 8, Bandwidth: 1.40
	  Tab 2, Type: Hi Pass, Frequency: 700, Gain: 0, Bandwidth: 2 (default)
	  Tab 3, Type: Low Pass, Frequency: 2800, Gain: 0, Bandwidth: 2 (default)
ReaGate 1 - Threshold -3.5 dB, Send MIDI on open/close enabled, note: 62, the rest is default

----- Hats band

ReaGate 1 - Threshold -13.8 dB, Send MIDI on open/close enabled, note: 64, the rest is default

4. Create a send from the track with the above chain to another empty track

5. Disable Audio send, disable Record monitoring

6. In the record button right click context menu select Record: output -> Record: output (MIDI)

7. In the record button right click context menu select Track recording settings (Input Quantize, Format, etc.)

Enable 'Quantize track MIDI recording' option

Set Quantize to: 1/16

Enable 'Quantize note-offs'

Strength 100%

The rest is to taste but for the sake accuracy keep Swing at 0% and 'Quantize within' sliders at 0% and 100%

8. Record on the second track

9. While it's directly below the original audio item open the recorded MIDI file in the MIDI Editor 
docked in the bottom docker and tweak the recording relative to the orgiginal audio.

The options 'Sync Editor transport to project transport' and 'Use the same grid division in arrange view and MIDI Editor'

under MIDI Editor Options can be enabled.

-- TCP custom action buttons (since v7)

Changing the actions of custom buttons is quite simple: in the rtconfig file they are located in a separate block. 
Find the text "CUSTOM BUTTONs, from here", this will be the beginning of the button code.
In the first half, the sizes of the buttons and their positions are set (I do not recommend changing this, 
the code there is quite complex even for me). And in the second half there are actions assigned to buttons. 
On lines starting with "custom tcp.custom." there is what you need.
For example, the width button code:

custom tcp.custom.wdth "W" _RS8971d98edc3d0bbfc747e3717f63e4143b267fc2 "Toggle Width Knob" 


The first W inside the quotes is the letter that shows on the button.
_RS8971d98edc3d0bbfc747e3717f63e4143b267fc2 is the ID action command that this button launches.
and
Toggle Width Knob inside quotes is the tooltip text that appears when you hover the mouse over the button.

You can change these three values at your discretion, getting different display and different bound actions. Same for other buttons.
After making changes to the code, do not forget to reload the theme for the changes to take effect.

I just discovered by accident that there is an undocumented alternative syntax for "@param" line in presets. The alternate syntax is

Code:

for example instead of:

Code:
//@param1:alpha 'alpha' 1 0 1 .5 .01
//@param2:zoom 'zoom' 1 0.01 4 1 0.01
//@param3:offX 'offset x' 0 -1 1 0 0.001
//@param4:offY 'offset y' 0 -1 1 0 0.001

you can write:

Code:
//@param alpha 'alpha' 1 0 1 .5 .01
//@param zoom 'zoom' 1 0.01 4 1 0.01
//@param offX 'offset x' 0 -1 1 0 0.001
//@param offY 'offset y' 0 -1 1 0 0.001

so you may reorder parameters or insert new ones without renumbering

BTW did you know you can increase the precision of the "rotate" angle of the "Track opacity/zoom/pan - video processor" just by changing

Code:
//@param5:rotate 'rotate' 0 -360 360 0 1

with

-- Create custom named command IDs for custom actions and scripts

a method discovered by X-Raym


1. Install a script or create a custom action in the Action list

3. Replace its current named command ID which looks like so "d6bfa01f0785664bac5abb42b0035b9e" inside the .ReaperKeyMap file

4. Import it back into the Action list

(with scripts they must keep residing at the same path, otherwise the path too can be modified inside the .ReaperKeyMap file: 

if the script is located inside the \Scripts directory its path must be relative to it, if it's located outside of it

it must be absolute)

5. Delete the old entries

Steps 4 and 5 can be swapped


SOME WARNINGS AND GUIDELINES

This method is a hack. It had for purpose to showcase a problem, and our desire to fínd a way to overcome it. 

Cockos developpers personnaly recommend to not abuse of it, and even to not use it at all. 

Speaking about COMMAND_ID, I don’t know yet all we have to know to make a good one, but based on what I was 

from SWS extensions, I will advice you to keep it concise, without spaces, and write it in UPPERCASE. Of course, 

it has to be unique, so add your pseudo as preíx may be a way to be sure that your COMMAND_ID will be unique.

A proper COMMAND_ID is critical. I Don’t know what are there limites but I have bad surprises with actions names 

so here as general guidelines based on my experiences: 

+ Letters, numbers and underscore (_) only

+ Letters Uppercase

+ Don’t start with an underscore (_): it will be added automatically

+ No more than 34 characters (it seems to work with more but this I cannot be sure)

+ Use a distinct initial as preíx (from your pseudo for eg), to be sure that your command IDs will be unique

Command_ID seem to be more îexible than that but it's impossible to test every scenario (aka call from other scripting language, 

diìerent OS, toolbars etc…), so keep it simple.



Script displayed name can be modified as well. In the .ReaperKeyMap file the script name will start with 'Custom:'

just like a custom action. After import it'll be replaced with 'Script:'

If you want to change a script displayed name, you will have to delete its current entry írst.

-- Fixed lanes settings priority


The options menu controls what happens when you record the *first* overlapping media item on a track. The first overlapping media item can:

1. Add lanes: this puts the track in fixed lane view, disabling "recording -> add lanes in layers" for that track.

2. Add lanes in layers: this puts the track in fixed lane view, enabling "recording -> add lanes in layers" for that track.

3. Both of those options disabled: in this case one of the other behaviors in the options menu applies (split items, tape mode, etc).

These options only affect what happens when the first overlapping item is recorded, in other words the options menu defines the default behavior for overlapping items.

Once an overlapping item has been recorded on a track, then the track settings determine the behavior. The track's "recording -> add lanes in layers" setting determines whether newly recorded lanes play in addition to previously playing lanes, or play exclusively.

The "record into first available lane" track setting is independent of all of the above behavior. If that is enabled, new recording will go into the first lane *that does not have an earlier recording above it*. The idea is that if you have overlapping recordings, the earlier recording is always above the later one.

-- REAPER search filter syntax (REAPER User Guide, chapter 6.2 Using Search Filters)


The description mainly uses FX Browser filter examples, but the priciple is the same everywhere.


THE SEARCH STRING IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE UNLESS THE CHARACTERS SEARCH TERM IS COMPRISED OF ARE OUTSIDE OF ASCII RANGE

You can search for more than one string within the same name. For example:

eq stereo will find all plugins with both eq and stereo anywhere in their name, regardless of the order in which they appear. eq  AND  stereo would produce exactly the same results.

The filter also supports other boolean search terms notably OR and NOT, and the use of parentheseses, e.g.: comp OR lim  finds and lists all plugins with comp or lim in their name.

eq ( cockos OR melda )  finds all Cockos and Melda plug-ins with eq in their name. You must leave a space both before and after the parentheses.

cockos ( eq OR comp )  finds all Cockos plug-ins with eq or comp in their name.

blue cat NOT ( flange OR phase )   finds and lists all Blue Cat plug-ins except those with flange or phase in their name.

( chorus OR delay ) NOT ( DX: OR JS: )  finds all effects with chorus or delay in their name except Direct X and JS ones.

There are some additional techniques that you can use to make your searches more finely tuned.

Enclosing a search string in quotes (either double or single) will find only those plug-ins where the text is matched exactly. For example: “sony noise”  would find Sony Noise Gate but not Sony Express FX Noise Gate. Likewise “reaverb” would find ReaVerb but not ReaVerbate.

Typing a space immediately after the opening quotes mark will limit the search to those items where the specified string is at the very beginning of a word. For example:
“ volu” will find plug-ins which include the word volume but not convolution..

Similarly, typing a space at the end of the string will only find those items where one of the words in the FX name ends with that string.

Starting a search string with ^ will find only those items whose name begins with the specified string, and using a $ at the end of a string will find only those names that end with that string.

For example, when working in the media explorer, using ^blues as a filter would list only those items whose names begin with blues.
Similarly, in the track manager, a filter such as guitar$ would display tracks with names such as lead guitar or rhythm guitar but not guitar solo.

-- Media Explorer player actions

Accessibility of these actions depends on the focused part of the Media Explorer window 

and the mouse modifier they're bound to but the relationship between these isn't obvious.

Clarification follows.


Preview: Play/stop (Space) -- work when File list / Preview player is in focus

Preview: Play/pause (Ctrl+Space) -- works when Folder tree / File list / Preview player is in focus

Preview: Play (Right arrow key) -- works when Preview player is in focus


The preview player focus is activated when the it's clicked directly, the problem is that in this case the playhead is moved

to the click location which is indesirable if you want to preview from a specific location.

There're several ways to activate Preview player focus without moving its playhead: click the Media info box (if open), 

click the player scrollbar only if the last focused window was File list, click the preview player while holding down Shift

1. Change the tempo envelope range max or min setting to the target value depending on whether the target tempo

2. Select the envelope points (must all be initially set to the same tempo value, won't work if their tempo values differ)

3. Drag them all the way up or down depending on whether the target tempo is greater or smaller than then point current tempo value

4. Restore the envelope range


If points intial tempo values differ, the method is still useful but the points must be dragged all the way up/down one by one

The good thing is that if there're points whose tempo value greater/smaller than the max/min range value which you change the setting to

they keep their values regardless of the range temporary max/min value, unless dragged explicitly up or down

-- Ensuring clean encoding of an audio into a lossless format, including streaming


The master should peak at -1 dBTP (true peak decibels)

Or at -2 dBTP if it's louder than -15 LUFS

If the master is already hitting close to 0 dBFS, it's advised to measure true peaks 

and reduce the level accordingly

From experience, reducing by 0.3 dB the level of a 16 bit 44100 Hz wav file peaking at 0 dB

ensures that conversion into mp3 doesn't produce overs

-- Recommended loudness of a master


No louder than -10 LUFS short-term at the loudest moments (with True Peaks no higher than -1)

If you follow this suggestion, you’ll be in great shape, in almost any genre. Your songs will 

be loud enough to sound “competitive”, whilst still retaining plenty of punch and dynamic contrast. 

They’ll stand shoulder to shoulder with anything else, on all the streaming platforms, 

and they won’t get turned down by a huge amount.

LFUS Integrated isn't a good metric because it's an average and two masters with the same average

may sound very different loudness wise.

-- Quick routing creation in projects with long track count so that there's no need 

-- to pull the cable from the source track to the detination track while scrolling


1. Place all your main destination tracks (busse, FX returns) at the top of the track list

2. Create a routing by right clicking the I/O (routing) button on the TCP/MCP

and select the destination track from the list in the context menu where it will be found

at the top of the list so no scrolling is needed

Alternatively left click the I/O (routing) button on the TCP/MCP and select the destinaion track

from the pull-up list.

Yet another alternative is using the Routing Matrix (Alt+R).

-- Spot files to their original position at the moment of recording


Works with files with embedded BWF chunk. REAPER does write the relevant into the recorded files.

1. Drop files into the project

2. Keep them selected or select all

3. Run action Item: Move to media source preferred position (BWF start offset)

This works provided the item source is looped (Loop source option is enabled) and its start matches its source start or its source is not looped
