Toolbar # inside REAPER and in reaper.ini correspondence (if MIDI piano roll toolbar wasn't opened which would threw all sequence off):
1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, 5 = 5, 6 = 6, 7 = 7, 8 = 8, MIDI 1 = 9,
MIDI 2 = 10, MIDI 3 = 11, MIDI 4 = 12, 
Main toolbar = 13, MIDI Piano Roll = 14 (both provisional, only counted if opened, toggle state of the MIDI piano roll toolbar in Arrange and of Main toolbar opened separately is registered in reaper.ini in the wnd_vis= key of a toolbar whose number each of them has assumed)
9 = 17, 10 = 18, 11 = 19, 12 = 20, 13 = 21, 14 = 22, 15 = 23, 16 = 24
MIDI 5 = 25, MIDI 6 = 26, MIDI 7 = 27, MIDI 8 = 28

The reason for the gaps in numbering of toolbars of the same kind is historical. First there were 8 Arrange toobars and 4 MIDI (1 - 12), then 8 and 4 more were added respectively, so the count was resumed after the last MIDI toolbar number which was 12. Don't know why 15 and 16 were skipped.

Since REAPER 7, indices of the newly added toolbars
Regular ##17 - 32:
17 = 28, 18 = 29, 19 = 30, 20 = 31, 21 = 32, 22 = 33, 23 = 34, 24 = 35, 25 = 36, 26 = 37, 27 = 38, 28 = 39, 29 = 40, 30 = 41, 31 = 42, 32 = 43
MIDI ##9 - 16:
9 = 44, 10 = 45, 11 = 46, 12 = 47, 13 = 48, 14 = 49, 15 = 50, 16 = 51

In reaper.ini toolbar keys are formatted as toolbar:1=28 where the 1st number represents ordinal index of the opened toolbar included in the toolbar section in reaper.ini, e.g. [toolbar:1], which is assigned incrementally as toolbars are being opened, while the 2nd number is internal toolbar index listed above. The open toolbar indices are reused, i.e. if all toolbars are closed and then opened in a different order, to toolbar:1 key a different internal toolbar index will be assigned and so on.

There's now also Media Explorer toolbar, but its place in the sequence isn't clear

Data which governs the sequence if MIDI piano roll toolbar was opened, throwing the above listed sequence off:

[REAPER]
dockermode3=1 -- left
0 = bottom, 1 = left, 2 = top, 3 = right,  32768 = unattached to the main window (floating docked)
Correspond to the docker right-click context menu options:
'Attached Docker position:bottom' = 0
'Attached Docker position:left' = 1
'Attached Docker position:top' = 2
'Attached Docker position:right' = 3
'Attach Docker to main window' OFF (floating docker) = 32768 - detached manually by dragging, 32770 - detached via action 40313 'View: Attach/unattach docker to/from main window' / option in the context menu
'Attach Toolbar Docker to main window' (dockermode15) OFF (floating Toolbar Docker) = 32770
when ON then previously listed values are used
Closed floating Docker = 98304 originally floated by dragging and having ID 32768 before closure
Closed floating Docker = 98306 originally floated via action and having ID 32770 before closure
Hidden Docker attached to main window = 65536 - bottom, 65537 - left, 65538 - top, 65539 - right -- added to dockermode in particular, replacing position value


Governs the position of a given toolbar in the toolbar docker.
The digit before the equal sign (3) refers to the rightmost digit assigned to a toolbar in secton [REAPERdockpref], e.g. toolbar:9=0.50000000 3. '3' stands for the ordinal number of a toolbar added to the toolbar docker, i.e. toolbar 9 was added 3d. The count starts from 0. The 'dockermode' keys for different toolbars may be scattered all over the [REAPER] section.

dockerwprio1= 'docker width priority' for split dockers, number stands for one of the splits, but logic or numbering isn't clear

dockersel2=toolbar:28 -- selected toolbar tab in the docker

-- Re-numbering of toolbars if MIDI piano roll toolbar was opened, arbitrary, zero based
toolbar:1=13 // MIDI piano roll (14) = 1 in reaper.ini in the section name [toolbar:1]
toolbar:2=0 // Toolbar 1 from the above list = 2 in reaper.ini in the section name [toolbar:2]
toolbar:4=1 // Toolbar 2 from the above list = 4 in reaper.ini in the section name [toolbar:4]

These numbers before equal sign are reflected in indivdual toolbar sections, e.g.

[toolbar:4] -- 4 would be that number and correspond to Toolbar 1 as per re-numbering above
wnd_vis=1
dock=0 -- toolbar right-click context menu -> Position toolbar -> In toolbar docker
wnd_left=9
wnd_top=42
wnd_width=349
wnd_height=81

And are used in [REAPERdockpref] section which governs docker position

[REAPERdockpref]
vkb=0.58187991 0
toolbar:9=0.50000000 2
toolbar=0.00000000 2	-- last added toolbar
toolbar:1=0.50000000 0 -- Attached docker positon: right (when dragged)
toolbar:2=0.50000000 2 -- Attached docker positon: top (when dragged)
toolbar:3=0.50000000 1 -- Attached docker positon: left (when dragged)
toolbar:4=0.50000000 3 -- = pos. of the tab in multi-docker   Attached docker positon: bottom (when dragged)
toolbar:5=0.00000000 2
toolbar:7=0.00000000 15 -- once 'dock' key value in the toolbar section becomes 1 as floating toolbar is positioned In Toolbar docker (see above), dockermode value 15 is added here

When toolbars sit in the Toolbar Docker their Open/close actions toggle state doesn't change whether their tab is closed or not.
To effectively close a toolbar in the Toolbar Docker via action the Toolbar Docker must be visible.

All newly opened toolbars are assigned dockermode 15 which references a dedicated global Toolbar docker and are positioned in the docker position currently assigned to this dockermode in reaper.ini, e.g. dockermode15=1. Thus all are assembled in the same docker being separated by tabs. The dockermode 15 for a particular toolbar is only changed according to the legend above when it's manually dragged to another position.

It appears there're 15 available dockers for each individual toolbar (or application window) counted from 0 to 14 and one Toolbar docker which can contain all toobars and be attached to the main window. So a single docker cannot be split to more than 15 sections.

A docker is split when different dockermodes have the same docker position value, e.g.

[REAPERdockpref]
toolbar:1=0.50000000 3
toolbar:4=0.50000000 2

[REAPER]
dockermode3=1
dockermode2=1

Toolbars 1 & 4 have different dockermodes 3 & 2 respectively and both sit in a split docker on the left 1

Toolbars share a docker being separated by tabs, when different toolbars have the same dockermode, e.g.

[REAPERdockpref]
toolbar:1=0.50000000 3
toolbar:4=0.50000000 3

[REAPER]
dockermode3=1

Toolbars 1 & 4 have the same dockermode 3 and sit in the same docker on the left 1 with tabs for each one of them.
This is the default mode

If there're more than one identical entries for the same toolbar in [REAPERdockpref] section the earlier one has a priority.

In horizontal dockers toolbars are positioned from right to left where the leftmost tab belongs to the last toolbar to be opened.
In vertical dockers they're positioned from top to bottom with the bottommost being the last to be opened.

MIDI Editor

[REAPERdockpref]
midiedit=0.50000000 1 -- MIDI Editor window dockermode number, refers to dockermode1 whose position values are identical to those of toolbars
fxbrowser=0.50000000 2 -- FX browser ~

MIDI toolbars in the MIDI Editor section don't report toggle state, their toggle state can be gotten from their counterparts in the Main section.

-- MIDI editor assignment to dockermode index only changes when it's being docked by dragging
-- if it's being docked via context menu the dockermode it's already assigned to is re-pointed to the new location
-- could be applicable to any window
-- midiedit key dockermode data only changes for the last active MIDI Editor even if there're several in the project
-- MIDI editor dock state like any MIDI editior toggle action can only be retrieved when MIDI editor is active
-- if there're more than one MIDI editor window open each one will have to be activated in turn and its dock state checked
-- which is impossible; decided to use it anyway so any change in MIDI Editor window regardless of its dock position
-- will trigger update just in case;
-- besides, MIDIEditor_GetActive() isn't reliable since it returns the pointer of the last focused MIDI Editor 
-- attached to a docker when the docker is closed https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=278871
