Toolbar # inside REAPER and in reaper.ini correspondence (if MIDI piano roll toolbar wasn't opened which would threw all sequence off):
1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, 5 = 5, 6 = 6, 7 = 7, 8 = 8, MIDI 1 = 9,
MIDI 2 = 10, MIDI 3 = 11, MIDI 4 = 12, 
Main toolbar = 13, MIDI Piano Roll = 14 (both provisional, only counted if opened, toggle state of the MIDI piano roll toolbar in Arrange and of Main toolbar opened separately is registered in reaper.ini in the wnd_vis= key of a toolbar whose number each of them has assumed)
9 = 17, 10 = 18, 11 = 19, 12 = 20, 13 = 21, 14 = 22, 15 = 23, 16 = 24
MIDI 5 = 25, MIDI 6 = 26, MIDI 7 = 27, MIDI 8 = 28

There's now also Media Explorer toolbar, but its place in the sequence isn't clear

Data which governs the sequence if MIDI piano roll toolbar was opened, throwing the above listed sequence off:

[REAPER]
dockermode3=1 -- left
0 = bottom, 1 = left, 2 = top, 3 = right,  32768 = unattached to the main window (floating docked)
Correspond to the docker right-click context menu options:
'Attached Docker position:bottom' = 0
'Attached Docker position:left' = 1
'Attached Docker position:top' = 2
'Attached Docker position:right' = 3
'Attach Docker to main window' OFF (floating toolbar docked in an individual Docker) = 32768
'Attach Toolbar Docker to main window' (dockermode15) OFF (floating Toolbar Docker) = 32770
when ON then previously listed values are used
Closed individual floating Docker = 98304
Closed floating Toolbar Docker = 98306
Hidden individual Docker attached to main window = 65536
Hidden Docker attached to main window = 65536 - bottom, 65537 - left, 65538 - top, 65539 - right -- added to dockermode in particular, replacing position value


Governs the position of a given toolbar in the toolbar docker.
The digit before the equal sign (3) refers to the rightmost digit assigned to a toolbar in secton [REAPERdockpref], e.g. toolbar:9=0.50000000 3. '3' stands for the ordinal number of a toolbar added to the toolbar docker, i.e. toolbar 9 was added 3d. The count starts from 0. The 'dockermode' keys for different toolbars may be scattered all over the [REAPER] section.

dockerwprio1= 'docker width priority' for split dockers, number stands for one of the splits, but logic or numbering isn't clear

dockersel2=toolbar:28 -- selected toolbar tab in the docker

-- Re-numbering of toolbars if MIDI piano roll toolbar was opened, arbitrary, zero based
toolbar:1=13 // MIDI piano roll (14) = 1 in reaper.ini
toolbar:2=0 // Toolbar 1 from the above list = 2 in reaper.ini
toolbar:4=1 // Toolbar 2 from the above list = 4 in reaper.ini

These numbers before equal sign are reflected in indivdual toolbar sections, e.g.

[toolbar:4] -- 4 would be that number and correspond to Toolbar 1 as per re-numbering above
wnd_vis=1
dock=0 -- toolbar right-click context menu -> Position toolbar -> In toolbar docker
wnd_left=9
wnd_top=42
wnd_width=349
wnd_height=81

And are used in [REAPERdockpref] section which governs docker position

[REAPERdockpref]
vkb=0.58187991 0
toolbar:9=0.50000000 2
toolbar=0.00000000 2	-- last added toolbar
toolbar:1=0.50000000 0 -- Attached docker positon: right (when dragged)
toolbar:2=0.50000000 2 -- Attached docker positon: top (when dragged)
toolbar:3=0.50000000 1 -- Attached docker positon: left (when dragged)
toolbar:4=0.50000000 3 -- = pos. of the tab in multi-docker   Attached docker positon: bottom (when dragged)
toolbar:5=0.00000000 2
toolbar:7=0.00000000 15 -- once 'dock' key value in the toolbar section becomes 1 as floating toolbar is positioned In Toolbar docker (see above), dockermode value 15 is added here

When toolbars sit in the Toolbar Docker their Open/close actions toggle state doesn't change whether their tab is closed or not.
To effectively close a toolbar in the Toolbar Docker via action the Toolbar Docker must be visible.

All newly opened toolbars are assigned dockermode 15 which references a dedicated global Toolbar docker and are positioned in the docker position currently assigned to this dockermode in reaper.ini, e.g. dockermode15=1. Thus all are assembled in the same docker being separated by tabs. The dockermode 15 for a particular toolbar is only changed according to the legend above when it's manually dragged to another position.

It appears there're 15 available dockers for each individual toolbar (or application window) counted from 0 to 14 and one Toolbar docker which can contain all toobars and be attached to the main window. So a single docker cannot be split to more than 15 sections.

A docker is split when different dockermodes have the same docker position value, e.g.

[REAPERdockpref]
toolbar:1=0.50000000 3
toolbar:4=0.50000000 2

[REAPER]
dockermode3=1
dockermode2=1

Toolbars 1 & 4 have different dockermodes 3 & 2 respectively and both sit in a split docker on the left 1

Toolbars share a docker being separated by tabs, when different toolbars have the same dockermode, e.g.

[REAPERdockpref]
toolbar:1=0.50000000 3
toolbar:4=0.50000000 3

[REAPER]
dockermode3=1

Toolbars 1 & 4 have the same dockermode 3 and sit in the same docker on the left 1 with tabs for each one of them.
This is the default mode

If there're more than one identical entries for the same toolbar in [REAPERdockpref] section the earlier one has a priority.

In horizontal dockers toolbars are positioned from right to left where the leftmost tab belongs to the last toolbar to be opened.
In vertical dockers they're positioned from top to bottom with the bottommost being the last to be opened.

MIDI Editor

[REAPERdockpref]
midiedit=0.50000000 1 -- MIDI Editor window dockermode number, refers to dockermode1 whose position values are identical to those of toolbars
fxbrowser=0.50000000 2 -- FX browser ~

[midiedit]
docked=1 - docked, 0 - undocked (float)

[REAPER]
wnd_w=1372
wnd_h=740

Program window dimensions


leftpanewid=  		- TCP width if it was ever changed from the default

MIDI toolbars in the MIDI Editor section don't report toggle state, their toggle state can be gotten from their counterparts in the Main section.

Any window which doesn't yet have docker values in reaper.ini is by default docked at the position assigned to 'dokermode0'. Only when its repositioned its value is added to [REAPERdockpref] section


fxadd_dock= 		- 'fxbrowser'
fxadd_vis=

undownd_vis=
mixwnd_dock=		- 'mixer'
mixwnd_vis=
transport_vis=		- 'transport', 
transport_dock=		- 0 when is set to 'Dock transport in docker', not in the Main window, the position is governed by dockermode assigned to 'transport' 				  key in [REAPERdockpref] section
transport_dock_pos=	- when docked in Main window: 768 - below Arrange, 769 - above Ruler, 770 - bottom of  the main window, 
			  771 - Top of the main window,
